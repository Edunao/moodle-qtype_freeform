# qtype_freeform
Question type developped for the LudiMoodle project.

This question type allows one to create mathematical questions extremely simply while accepting answers that are equivalent to the one in the question:

Example:

Question text:
What is the formula for distance as a function of speed and time? d=?(s t + 1/2 u t^2) 

Valid answers include things like:
(s t + 1/2 u t^2)
(tÂ²*u)/2 + t*s
...

Additional features make it simple to create questions in the form of grids or pyramids.
